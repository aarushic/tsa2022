<b> First and most important, prepare to leave with more knowledge you came in with!
</b>
</p>
       <p>
         
         Attending your very first Climate conference? Here is a small list of things to keep in mind and know !

       </p>
       
       <p style="font-size:20px">

<b>1. As mentioned above, you're definitely going to leave a lot more informed about the world around you. 
</b>

</p><p>With 8 guest speakers, who are highly acclaimed in the environmental field, and over 100 highly acknowledged individuals planning innovative and educational seminars and activities, there is no doubt that there's something new for everyone.  


       </p>
       <p style="font-size:20px"><b>2. Why should you care?</b></p>
  
       <p> A better life for you, a better life for your kids, a better life for everyone. 
We all deserve to breathe cleaner air, drink cleaner water, and have an ecosystem and habitat where we can grow and survive. Especially since we as humans are the reasons why climate change is an issue.

       <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>3. Will conferences like this really work?
</b>
       </p>
       <p>
         This question depends on you. We have all the resources and information to raise awareness, and even give you opportunities to have a part, but making sure that it makes a difference is based on what you do with what we give you. 

       </p>
      
         
       <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>4.Where did the idea of climate conferences come from?

</b>
       </p>
       <p>
 Each one of us involved in our organization had one goal, to make a difference in a world where it is definitely needed. We all wanted to get our points, our thoughts, and the urgency of climate change across the globe. 

       </p>
       <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>5. Is this in ties with organizations like the UN?

</b>
       </p>
       <p>
         Yes! We have a very close and productive exchange of ideas and information. With similar goals, we make sure to hold similar practices and broaden our reach. 

       </p>
              <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>6. For how long have we been doing this?


</b>
       </p>
       <p>
Our climate concerts are fairly recent compared to our organization itself.  Our organization dates back to the 2000s and we started our climate conferences in early 2012. 

       </p>
       </p>
              <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>7. How is this affected by the pandemic?



</b>
       </p>
       <p>
Although our past conferences have been in person, we’ve always had a virtual aspect to it. So in light of the pandemic, we’ve decided to go fully online.

       </p>
 
              <p style="font-size:20px">
         <b>8. What should I take away from this?




</b>
       <p>
Other than the information we present to you, the huge role you play in Climate Change.
